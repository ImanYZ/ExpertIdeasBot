ExpertIdeasBot
==============

We are a group of researchers at the University of Michigan, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, working to find practical ways to motivate academic researchers who have published a number of research papers in various domains, to review Wikipedia pages and improve them.  As academic researchers typically do not have time to learn to edit Wikipedia pages, we will ask their comments on pages in their domain of expertise, and post these comments to the corresponding talk pages, which can potentially help active Wikipedians on those pages to take advantage of experts' feedback and apply them as they see fit to the main article.  To this end, we need to implement a bot which posts experts' feedback as new sections on Talk pages.We are a group of researchers at the University of Michigan, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, working to find practical ways to motivate academic researchers who have published a number of research papers in various domains, to review Wikipedia pages and improve them.
