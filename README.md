ExpertIdeasBot
==============

We are a group of researchers at the University of Michigan, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, working to find practical ways to motivate academic researchers who have published a number of research papers in various domains, to review Wikipedia pages and improve them.  As academic researchers typically do not have time to learn to edit Wikipedia pages, we will ask their comments on pages in their domain of expertise, and post these comments to the corresponding talk pages, which can potentially help active Wikipedians on those pages to take advantage of experts' feedback and apply them as they see fit to the main article.  To this end, we need to implement a bot which posts experts' feedback as new sections on Talk pages.We are a group of researchers at the University of Michigan, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, working to find practical ways to motivate academic researchers who have published a number of research papers in various domains, to review Wikipedia pages and improve them.

Our program is going to send emails to academic researchers who have published a number of research papers in various domains to review specific Wikipedia articles related to their domain of expertise. Once the experts provide us with their comments about the content of these articles, our ExpertIdeasBot will post these comments as new sections to the corresponding talk pages. All the new sections which are going to be created will have the following format:

Title: Professor ...'s comment on this article

Professor ... has recently published the following research publications which are related to this Wikipedia article:

Reference 1: ... , Number of Ciations: ...

Reference 2: ... , Number of Ciations: ...

Reference 3: ... , Number of Ciations: ...

...

Professor ... has reviewed this Wikipedia page, and provided us with the following comments to improve its quality:

... ... ...

We hope Wikipedians on this talk page can take advantage of these comments and improve the quality of this page accordingly.


Then the bot will add the Talk page and also the corresponding Wikipedia page to my watchlist, so we will be able to observe the active Wikipedians’ reactions to the experts’ comments, which will help us to realize:

if these comments really help Wikipedians to improve the quality of these pages or not.
other factors that we can add to the experts’ comments to help Wikipeidians.
